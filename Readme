3. Write two methods, each using a different sorting algorithm and not using built in sorts or external libraries, 
   to sort a List of an n-Payment objects from most recent to oldest.
4. Write at least two JUNIT tests (one per method) to generate a randomly ordered list with random payment dates and sort them.
   Record the time it takes to sort and verify that the list is ordered correctly.
